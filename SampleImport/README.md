Sample Import
=======================

The extension here in the repository is a smaple only.  This is meant to provide enough information to get you started on your own importation.  

The example is dependent on two other extensions:

1. [Ho_Import ](https://github.com/ho-nl/Ho_Import)
1. [AvS_FastSimpleImport](https://github.com/avstudnitz/AvS_FastSimpleImport) 

You will want to read both of those to really get the idea of this style of data importing.  There are comments in the simple extension.  There will be more information comming soon.
