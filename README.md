=======================

This repository is for putting up sample importer extensions for `Magento`.  If you have an importer for `Magento` please make a pull request, but insure that you follow some simple guidelines.

1. Set you extension to be with in a folder with your extension name. e.g. ***`SampleImport/app/code/etc..`***
1. That you provide a `README.md` file at the root of your example.  e.g. ***`SampleImport/README.md`*** 
1. The your solution is tested and working.  This is not a place for your active development, but an area of access to stable solutions.

Other wise you're pretty open on how it works, as long as the extension is to import data to `Magento` platform.
